# What is it
Website for Sharing travel logs, I've been building this website out for a while now, it first started as a way to learn web dev but I just bought a domain so I have to commit the rest of my life to it. It's a website for sharing travel itinerates, kind of like trip advisor without the advertisers selling you a plane tickets or hotels.

# My vision for this project
I want this to be a collection of travel itineraries where people post their honest experiences whitout selling you a plane ticket or a hotel stay. There would be travel destinations with detailed costs from hotel stay to renting a bike, and a step by step plan for people to follow or take inspiration from. I often hear stories of friends going on holiday expecting to spend only 100 - 200 pounds while they are there, but end up superised by the true price even after heavy research, I want this website to change that.

# Why Open Source and How Can You Help
I have decided to open source so I can see the website come to life because right now I haven't got the skills or the time to develop this further. If you are a developer, designer, writer, travel influencer or if you have a skill set that you think can help elevate this project, feel free to contribute on this GitHub or contact me.
